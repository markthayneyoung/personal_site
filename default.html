<h1>Mark Thayne Young</h1>

<p>Hello there! My name is Mark Young and I currently study Information Systems and Technology at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah. Golden Gate Bridge
I was born and raised in Modesto, California. I have an amazing brother and two incredible parents. 
My whole life I wanted to be a professional baseball player and I believed I had the potential to do so, 
however my career was cut short due to elbow injuries (one needing surgery) and shoulder injuries (rotator cuff). 
Although baseball was the love of my life, I have developed a passion within a short time for programming and web development.
I am a very creative person. When I was young I started filming movies. I would grab my parents very old camcorder, 
invite my friends over, and start filming away at what we believed to be the next big movie to grab the nation's attention. 
These little movies actually taught me basic filming and directing skills, and as I got older and matured I started learning to edit film. 
I started shooting at weddings and was actually paid for it. I even got an internship working for a professional baseball team in 
Modesto, California notoriously known as the "Modesto Nuts". I filmed live footage as well as worked with some players filming local commercials.
Even though I was good at filming, I didn't see a bright future in it. I wanted to find something that would allow me to be just as 
creative while also providing a living for myself and loved ones. A good friend of mine intoduced me to the web development and programming world 
and I knew I had found a potential fit for myself.
So here I am, trying to make a living for myself doing something I love. 
From baseball to creating websites and windows applications, my goal in life is to do something 
I love and something that I find fun, and my belief is that I am on the right track!</p>
